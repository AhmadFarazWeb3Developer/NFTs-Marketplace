------------------ Marketplace Policy ------------------





what if Marketplace restrict a collection then ?
the buyer can sell their collections ?


------------------- Collection Policy -------------------

Collection Owner :
->  Minted token A
->  List token A


Token Buyer:
->  Bought A 
->  Allow  or  Disallow for sale  
->  Buyer updated the price 
->  Again Allowed for sale A 



@Note:
->  Marketplace can dislist the token A but cannot stop him from selling , beaucse its his right 
-> owner holds the tokens not the collection contract



Token A is already listed and allowed for sale

Buyer Bought the token A 

Initially marketplace is owner, transfered from marketplace to Buyer 
still listed 

Already allowed for sale,
Buyer can Disallow for sale,

Buyer updated Token A
